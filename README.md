# Notes

This app helps you to keep your notes on the device storage.

Technology used: Dart/Flutter, Bloc, Floor Database, and more... such as:
Clean Arch, TDD, Unit test

In spite of look of the app being not really fancy, the real power of it is its architecture.
The best clean architecture practices were used.
Also it was developed using TDD(Test Driven Development), so there are (A LOT OF) unit tests.

You can easily add a note to the list, edit it, give it a color and delete it!
